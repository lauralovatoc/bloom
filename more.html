                    <h2>About Coffee</h2>
                    <p>The history of coffee consumption by humans begins with a 9th-century Ethiopian legend. According to the story, a goat herder named Kaldi noticed that his goats became more energetic after eating the red berries of a certain plant. Curious, Kaldi tried the berries himself and also felt more alert. Monks at a nearby monastery learned of the plant and began using it to prepare a drink that helped them stay awake during long prayers. The coffee plant spread from what is now Ethiopia to Yemen, where Arabs began cultivating it systematically in the 15th century. In Mecca, the first “coffee houses” (qahveh khaneh) appeared, quickly becoming centers for social, religious, and political discussion. By the 17th century, coffee had reached Europe, where it quickly became popular. Despite some initial resistance — some called it the "devil’s wine" — coffee soon became a staple in homes and cafés, especially in England, France, and Italy. Coffeehouses became important intellectual hubs during the Enlightenment. In the 18th century, with global demand rising, Europeans began growing coffee in tropical colonies like Brazil, which would later become the world’s largest producer.</p>

                    <h2>Benefits</h2>
                    <p>Coffee is well known for its stimulating effects due to caffeine, a compound that acts directly on the central nervous system. It helps increase alertness, improve mood and concentration, and reduce feelings of fatigue. Studies also suggest that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, coffee contains antioxidants like chlorogenic acids, which help fight free radicals and may have anti-inflammatory properties. However, excessive consumption can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and increased blood pressure in caffeine-sensitive individuals.</p>

                    <h2>About Matcha</h2>
                    <p>The story of matcha — a type of powdered green tea — has deep roots in Eastern culture, especially in China and Japan. It began in China during the Tang Dynasty (7th–10th centuries), when tea leaves were steamed, formed into blocks for easy transport, and later ground and mixed with hot water. This method evolved in the Song Dynasty (10th–13th centuries), when grinding dried leaves into powder and whisking them became popular among Buddhist monks and the elite. In the 12th century, the monk Eisai brought tea seeds and the powdered preparation method to Japan, where matcha took on spiritual significance. Japanese Zen monks embraced matcha as part of their meditation rituals, valuing its calming alertness — thanks to the combination of caffeine and L-theanine. Over time, matcha evolved in Japan into the tea ceremony (chanoyu) — a highly ritualized and artistic practice that flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries, especially under the influence of masters like Sen no Rikyū. For centuries, matcha remained almost exclusive to Japanese culture, until it gained global popularity in the 21st century, associated with health benefits, mental clarity, and a natural lifestyle. Today, it's found in modern drinks, desserts, and even skincare products.</p>

                    <h2>Benefits</h2>
                    <p>Because matcha is made from the entire ground green tea leaf, it is more nutrient-dense than regular green tea. It also contains caffeine, but in lower amounts than coffee, and it's combined with L-theanine — an amino acid that promotes relaxation without drowsiness. This combination offers a calm, sustained alertness, ideal for mental focus and meditation. Matcha is extremely rich in antioxidants, especially catechins like EGCG, known for their anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and heart-protective properties. It can also help regulate metabolism and support cholesterol control. Matcha is appreciated for its smooth and sustainable effects on both body and mind.</p>
